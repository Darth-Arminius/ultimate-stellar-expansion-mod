Our scientists have managed to make possible the impossible and bypass the singularity all together, instead drawing upon the dark energy directly. This has allowed for generating more instant power than was ever possible while using singularities, but at what cost? It's clear that dark energy plays a vital role in the expansion and lifecycle of the unvierse, messing with that could cause serious irreversible consquences. It was already confirmed that dark energy expansion was being reversed local to the singularity but utilising dark energy directly has taken that to a dangerous new level, could we possibly reverse the universe, and everything in it, all the way back to it's inception?"
