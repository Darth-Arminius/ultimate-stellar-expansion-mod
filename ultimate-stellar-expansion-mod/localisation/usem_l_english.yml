 # Photonic Deflectors

 usem_tech_shields_6: "Photonic Deflectors VI"
 usem_tech_shields_6_desc: "Advancements in optics and quantum particles has led us to this new generation of shield technology. Highly concentrated photons are able to create an almost solid like bubble and is especially effective at absorbing energy weapons. Currently, this technology is new and highly advanced so we're only capable of using it in smaller components but with further study and advancements, we could potentially create impenetrable shields.\n\n"

 # Ultra-light Nanocomposite Materials

 usem_tech_ship_armor_6: "Ultra-light Nanocomposite Materials VI"
 usem_tech_ship_armor_6_desc: "Advancements in miniaturisation and compacting mass has allowed our scientists and engineers to create a far denser yet lighter and relatively smaller armour plating using nanocomposite materials. This plating is stronger than that made from neutronium materials simply due to it's greater density while maintaining the same mass and size. We should look into replicating this technology with stronger materials.\n\n"
